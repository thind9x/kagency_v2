          All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat
          predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator
          on the Internet
        </h3>
        <p>
          It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful
          of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
          reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from
          repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
